# mlr3 website

The [mlr-org.com](https://mlr-org.com/) website is created with [Distill for R Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html) and published with [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).

# Project Structure

* `mlr3website` - The root directory contains the `mlr3website` R package.
* `mlr-org/` - Distill project.
* `mlr-org/docs/` - Rendered website. Is created when `rmarkdown::render_site()` is called. Is not pushed to the remote repository.
* `mlr-org/_posts/` - Blog posts.
* `mlr-org/_gallery` - Gallery posts.
* `mlr-org/theme.css` - Custom styling.
* `.github` contains workflows to build website and render gallery posts

## How to change the website

* The website consists of pages and blog posts.
* Pages are `.Rmd` files located in the `mlr-org/` directory (e.g. `packages.Rmd`).
* Blog posts are stored in `_post` and `blog.Rmd` automatically list them.
* Gallery posts are stored in `_gallery` and `gallery.Rmd` automatically list them.
* Change the style only in `theme.css` and add comments to all changes.
* The files in `docs/` are the standalone static website which is published with GitHub Pages.
Changes in `docs/` are overwritten by `rmarkdown::render_site()`.
* See [rstudio.github.io/distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) to learn more about Distill.
