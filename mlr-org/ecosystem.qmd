The mlr3 ecosystem is a collection of R packages for machine learning.
The base package mlr3 only provides the basic building blocks for machine learning.
The extensions packages extent mlr3 with functionality for additional task types, learning algorithms, tuning algorithms, feature selection strategies, visualizations or preprocessing capabilities.
The packages are listed bellow with a short description.
For more information about the packages, check out their respective homepages.

The dot next to the package name indicates the [lifecycle stage](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html).

- Packages with a green dot <i class="bi-circle-fill status-stable" title = "[status-stable]"></i> are stable.
- Experimental packages are marked with an orange dot <i class="bi-circle-fill status-experimental" title = "[status-experimental]"></i>.
- Planned packages are marked with a red dot <i class="bi-circle-fill status-planned" title = "[status-planned]"></i>.
