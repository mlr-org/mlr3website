`mlr3` tries to be light on dependencies.
The following packages are at runtime:

*   [`parallelly`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=parallelly):
    Helper functions for parallelization. No extra recursive
    dependencies.
*   [`future.apply`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=future.apply):
    Resampling and benchmarking is parallelized with the
    [`future`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=future)
    abstraction interfacing many parallel backends.
*   [`backports`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=backports):
    Ensures backward compatibility with older R releases. Developed
    by members of the `mlr` team. No recursive dependencies.
*   [`checkmate`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=checkmate):
    Fast argument checks. Developed by members of the `mlr` team. No
    extra recursive dependencies.
*   [`mlr3misc`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mlr3misc):
    Miscellaneous functions used in multiple mlr3 [extension
    packages](https://mlr-org.com/ecosystem.html). Developed by the
    `mlr` team.
*   [`paradox`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=paradox):
    Descriptions for parameters and parameter sets. Developed by the

    Extension of Râ€™s `data.frame`. No recursive dependencies.
*   [`digest`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=digest) (via
    `mlr3misc`): Hash digests. No recursive dependencies.
