Due to the high amount of packages in the mlr3 ecosystem, it is hard to keep up with the latest changes across all packages.
This posts gives an overview by listing the recent release notes of mlr3 packages from the last quarter.
Note that only CRAN packages are listed here and the sort order is alphabetically.


# mlr3cluster 0.1.6

**Description** Cluster Extension for 'mlr3'

* Add states as row names to `usarrest` task.
* Remove dictionary items after unloading package.

# mlr3cluster 0.1.5

* Added Mclust learner
* Fix error associated with new dbscan release


# mlr3tuning 0.17.2

**Description** Hyperparameter Optimization for 'mlr3'

* feat: `AutoTuner` accepts instantiated resamplings now.
  The `AutoTuner` checks if all row ids of the inner resampling are present in the outer resampling train set when nested resampling is performed.
* fix: Standalone `Tuner` did not create a `ContextOptimization`.

# mlr3tuning 0.17.1

* fix: The `ti()` function did not accept callbacks.

# mlr3tuning 0.17.0

* feat: The methods `$importance()`, `$selected_features()`, `$oob_error()` and `$loglik()` are forwarded from the final model to the `AutoTuner` now.
* refactor: The `AutoTuner` stores the instance and benchmark result if `store_models = TRUE`.
* refactor: The `AutoTuner` stores the instance if `store_benchmark_result = TRUE`.

# mlr3tuning 0.16.0

* feat: Add new callback that enables early stopping while tuning to `mlr_callbacks`.
* feat: Add new callback that backups the benchmark result to disk after each batch.
* feat: Create custom callbacks with the `callback_tuning()` function.

# mlr3tuning 0.15.0

* fix: `AutoTuner` did not accept `TuningSpace` objects as search spaces.
* feat: Add `ti()` function to create a `TuningInstanceSingleCrit` or `TuningInstanceMultiCrit`.
* docs: Documentation has a technical details section now.
* feat: New option for `extract_inner_tuning_results()` to return the tuning instances.


# mlr3fselect 0.9.0

**Description** Feature Selection for 'mlr3'

* fix: Add `genalg` to required packages of `FSelectorGeneticSearch`.
* feat: Add new callback that backups the benchmark result to disk after each batch.
* feat: Create custom callbacks with the `callback_fselect()` function.

# mlr3fselect 0.8.0

* refactor: `FSelectorRFE` throws an error if the learner does not support the `$importance()` method.
* refactor: The `AutoFSelector` stores the instance and benchmark result if `store_models = TRUE`.
* refactor: The `AutoFSelector` stores the instance if `store_benchmark_result = TRUE`.
* feat: Add missing parameters from `AutoFSelector` to `auto_fselect()`.
* feat: Add `fsi()` function to create a `FSelectInstanceSingleCrit` or `FSelectInstanceMultiCrit`.
* refactor: Remove `unnest` option from `as.data.table.ArchiveFSelect()` function.


# mlr3mbo 0.1.1

**Description** Flexible Bayesian Optimization

* Initial CRAN upload


# mlr3spatial 0.3.1

**Description** Support for Spatial Objects Within the 'mlr3' Ecosystem

* chore: Remove `rgdal` dependency and require `raster` version 3.6-11.

# mlr3spatial 0.3.0

* feat: Add prediction on vector data to `spatial_predict()`.


# mlr3oml 0.7.0

**Description** Connector Between 'mlr3' and 'OpenML'

* feature: Add argument `task_type` to function `list_oml_tasks()`.
* fix: strings and nominals are distinguished for parquet files
* docs: Fixed some OpenML links
* docs: Renamed the docs for OpenML objects
* Renamed the sugar functions from:
  * `oml_data()` is now `odt()`
  * `oml_task() `is now `otsk()`
  * `oml_flow()` is now `oflw()`
  * `oml_run()` is now `orn`
  * `oml_collection()` is now `ocl()`
* Addresses a CRAN issue: examples fail gracefully if OpenML server is busy.


# bbotk 0.7.2

**Description** Black-Box Optimization Toolkit

* fix: Standalone `Tuner` and `FSelector` were rejected by `ContextOptimization`.

# bbotk 0.7.1

* feat: Data unrelated to a specific point evaluation can be written to `Archive$data_extra`.

# bbotk 0.7.0

* fix: `Terminator$format(with_params = TRUE)` printed an empty list when no parameter was set.
* refactor: `OptimizerIrace` automatically added the `instances` parameter to `Objective$constants`.
  From now on, the `instances` parameter can be also set manually.
* BREAKING CHANGE: `branin(xs)` is now `branin(x1, x2, noise)` and `branin_wu(x1, x2, fidelity)`.
* feat: Add `ObjectiveRFunMany` that can evaluate a list of configurations with a user supplied function.
* fix: If all configurations were missing a parameter, `ObjectiveRFunDt$eval_many()` did not create a column with `NA` for the missing parameter.
* refactor: The default of `digits` in `OptimizerIrace` is 15 now to avoid rounding errors.
* refactor: The bounds of double parameters were processed with only 4 decimal places in `OptimizerIrace`.
  By default, the bounds of double parameters are represented with 15 decimal places now.
  The `digits` parameter of `OptimizerIrace` also changes number of decimal places of the bounds now.

# bbotk 0.6.0

* fix: `OptimizerIrace` did not work with parameters with multiple dependencies.
* feat: Add new callback that backups the archive to disk to `mlr_callbacks`.
* feat: Create custom callbacks with the `callback_optimization()` function.
