knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

Due to the high amount of packages in the mlr3 ecosystem, it is hard to keep up with the latest changes across all packages.
This post tries to tackle this issue by listing all release notes of the packages most recent releases **in the last quarter**.
Note that only CRAN packages are listed here and the sort order is alphabetically.

Interval: 2021-07-01 - 2021-10-01

# bbotk 0.4.0 - https://github.com/mlr-org/bbotk

**Description: Black-Box Optimization Toolkit**

* Adds non dominated sorting with hypervolume contribution to `Archive`.
* Allows empty search space and domain.
* Extended `TerminatorEvals` with an additional hyperparameter `k` to define the
  budget depending on the dimension of the search space.
* Adds `bb_optimize()` function for quick optimization.
* Adds `OptimizerIrace` from irace package.

# mlr3 0.12.0 - https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3

**Description: Machine Learning in R - Next Generation**

* New method to assign labels to columns in tasks: `Task$label()`.
  These will be used in visualizations in the future.
* New method to add stratification variables: `Task$add_strata()`.
* New helper function `partition()` to split a task into a training and test
  set.
* New standardized getter `loglik()` for class `Learner`.
* New measures `"aic"` and `"bic"` to compute the Akaike Information Criterion
  or the Bayesian Information Criterion, respectively.
* New Resampling method: `ResamplingCustomCV`. Creates a custom resampling split
  based on the levels of a user-provided factor variable.
* New argument `encapsulate` for `resample()` and `benchmark()` to conveniently
  enable encapsulation and also set the fallback learner to the
  featureless learner. This is simply for convenience, configuring each learner
  individually is still possible and allows a more fine-grained control (#634,
  #642).
* New field `parallel_predict` for `Learner` to enable parallel predictions via
  the future backend. This currently is only enabled while calling the
  `$predict()` or `$predict_newdata` methods and is disabled during `resample()`
  and `benchmark()` where you have other means to parallelize.
* Deprecated public (and already documented as internal) field `$data` in
  `ResampleResult` and `BenchmarkResult` to simplify the API and avoid
  confusion. The converter `as.data.table()` can be used instead to access the
  internal data.
* Measures now have formal hyperparameters. A popular example where this is
  required is the F1 score, now implemented with customizable `beta`.
* Changed default of argument `ordered` in `Task$data()` from `TRUE` to `FALSE`.

# mlr3cluster 0.1.2 - https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3cluster

**Description: Cluster Extension for 'mlr3'**

* Add Hclust
* test and doc hclust
* Add within sum of squares measure
* add doc wss
* code factor adaptions

# mlr3filters 0.4.2 - https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3filters

**Description: Filter Based Feature Selection for 'mlr3'**

- Fixes an issue where argument `nfeat` was not passed down to {praznik} filters (#97)


# mlr3learners 0.5.1 - https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3learners

**Description: Recommended Learners for 'mlr3'**

- Improved how the added hyperparameter `mtry.ratio` is converted to `mtry` to
  simplify tuning.


# mlr3pipelines 0.3.4 - https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3pipelines

**Description: Preprocessing Operators and Pipelines for 'mlr3'**

* Stability: PipeOps don't crash when they have python/reticulate hyperparameter values.
* Documentation: Titles of PipeOp documentation articles reworked.


# mlr3spatiotempcv 1.0.0 - https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3spatiotempcv

**Description: Spatiotemporal Resampling Methods for 'mlr3'**

## Breaking

- `autoplot()`: removed argument `crs`.
  The CRS is now inferred from the supplied Task.
  Setting a different CRS than the task might lead to spurious issues and the initial idea of changing the CRS for plotting to have proper axes labeling does not apply (anymore) (#144)

## Features

- Added `autoplot()` support for `ResamplingCustomCV` (#140)

## Bug fixes

- `"spcv_block"`: Assert error if folds > 2 when `selection = "checkerboard"` (#150)
- Fixed row duplication when creating `TaskRegrST` tasks from `sf` objects (#152)

## Miscellaneous

- Upgrade tests to {vdiffr} 1.0.0
- Add {rgdal} to suggests and required it in `"spcv_block"` since it is required in {blockCV} >= 2.1.4 and {sf} >= 1.0


# mlr3tuning 0.9.0 - https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3tuning

**Description: Tuning for 'mlr3'**

- Adds `AutoTuner$base_learner()` method to extract the base learner from
  nested learner objects.
- `tune()` supports multi-criteria tuning.
- Allows empty search space.
- Adds `TunerIrace` from `irace` package.
- `extract_inner_tuning_archives()` helper function to extract inner tuning
  archives.
- Removes `ArchiveTuning$extended_archive()` method. The `mlr3::ResampleResults` are
  joined automatically by `as.data.table.TuningArchive()` and
  `extract_inner_tuning_archives()`.


# mlr3verse 0.2.3 - https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3verse

**Description: Easily Install and Load the 'mlr3' Package Family**

- Updated reexports.


# mlr3viz 0.5.6 - https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3viz

**Description: Visualizations for 'mlr3'**

- Compatibility fix for mlr3tuning.
- Fixed position of labels in barplot for `PredictionClassif`.

# mlr3viz 0.5.5

- Fixed another bug for ROC- and Precision-recall-curves (#79).
