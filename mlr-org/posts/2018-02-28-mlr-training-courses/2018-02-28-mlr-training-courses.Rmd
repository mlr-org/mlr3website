The [`mlr`: Machine Learning in R](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v17/15-066.html) package provides a generic, object-oriented and extensible framework for classification, regression, survival analysis and clustering for the statistical programming language R.
The package targets practitioners who want to quickly apply machine learning algorithms, as well as researchers who want to implement, benchmark, and compare their new methods in a structured environment.

We are happy to announce that we now offer training courses specialized on `mlr`:

- The [Munich R Courses](http://www.muenchner-r-kurse.de/einfuehrung-maschinelles-lernen/) already offer the three-day course "Machine Learning and Data Mining in R". <!--more-->
The course includes a basic introduction to theoretical concepts of machine learning and especially focuses on the [`mlr` package](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr).
The next course starts on May 2nd, 2018 and will be held in German (see [here](http://www.muenchner-r-kurse.de/kurs/machine-learning/)).
- The [Professional Certificate Program "Data Science"](http://www.datascience-certificate.de) also includes a short introduction to the `mlr` package. It is a brand new extra-occupational 10-day training at the University of Munich (LMU).
The certificate program starts in May 2018 and the application deadline is March 15th, 2018.
