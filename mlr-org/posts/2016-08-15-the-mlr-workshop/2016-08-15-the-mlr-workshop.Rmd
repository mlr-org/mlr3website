The *mlr developer team* is quite international: Germany, USA, Canada. The time difference between these countries sometimes makes it hard to communicate and develop new features.

The idea for this workshop or [sprint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(software_development)) was to have the possibility to talk about the project status, future and structure, exterminate imperishable bugs and start developing some fancy features.

Since we wanted to meet at a nice place we decided to go to Palermo, where the [department of statistics](https://www.unipa.it/dipartimenti/seas/) provided us with a room in the university for the workshop.

Twelve people from the developer team met from the 8. to 15. August to work on and with mlr.

## Result of the workhop

We closed a lot of issues and developed new features that we will release with version 2.10 of *mlr* in the next few days.
