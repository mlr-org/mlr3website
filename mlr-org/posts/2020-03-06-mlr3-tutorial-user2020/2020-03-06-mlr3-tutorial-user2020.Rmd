# mlr3 tutorial at the useR!2020 European hub

We are thrilled that we got accepted for a tutorial at the [useR!2020 satellite event in Munich](https://user2020muc.r-project.org/) on July 7th.
[Bernd Bischl](https://twitter.com/BBischl) and [Michel Lang](https://twitter.com/michellangts) will give an introduction to [mlr3](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com), the successor of the [mlr](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com) package for machine learning in R.


The main objective of the tutorial is to introduce and familiarize users with mlr3 and its ecosystem of extension packages.
This will allow participants to take advantage of its functionality for their own projects, in particular:

* how to benchmark and compare different machine learning approaches in a statistically sound manner,
* how to build complex machine learning workflows with [mlr3pipelines](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/), including preprocessing and stacked ensembles,
* automatic hyperparameter tuning and pipeline optimization (AutoML) with [mlr3tuning](https://mlr3tuning.mlr-org.com/),
* how to get the technical "nitty-gritties" for machine learning experiments right, e.g., speed up by parallelization, encapsulation of experiments in external processes or working on databases.

After the tutorial, participants will be able to implement complex solutions to real-world machine learning problems, and to evaluate the different design decisions necessary for such implementations, in particular the choice between different modelling and preprocessing techniques.


# About the useR!2020 satellite event in Munich

The conference is a satellite event of the "official" [useR!2020 in St. Louis](https://user2020.r-project.org/), USA.
It is actively supported by the [R Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/), and there will be streamed keynote talks from the US to Europe and vice versa.
The following speakers will give a keynote in Munich (you can find the tentative programme [here](https://user2020muc.r-project.org/programme/)):

* Kurt Hornik and Uwe Ligges about the future of [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* Anna Krystalli about computational reproducibility
* Przemys≈Çaw Biecek about explorable and explainable machine learning models

Note that there is still time to [submit an abstract](https://user2020muc.r-project.org/participation/) for a talk, a lightning talk or a poster.
Registration is also open now!
