Our Org is currently thinking about participating in [GSOC 2022](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) again.
We are considering which projects to propose and would also like to collect input.
This year's Google Summer of Code is not only directed at students but at a broader audience of people new to FOSS.

We have thought about the following projects:

* [mlr3multioutput](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3multioutput)
We would like for mlr3multioutput to include multi-label and general
multi-output techniques, such as learners and prediction post-processing methods.
Furthermore, some work on the evaluation of multi-output methods could drastically improve the package's utility.

* [mlr3fairness](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3fairness)
by now contains the basic infrastructure to audit algorithms for some notions of fairness.
We'd like to augment mlr3fairness with several bias mitigation techniques, as well as other notions of fairness.

* Queue-based asynchronous parallelization for R
mlr3 currently heavily relies on [future](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future) for parallelization.
Some tuning methods would profit from a different take on parallelization, where task queues are cleanly orchestrated on a central server.
The goal of this project would be to develop a general-purpose parallelization package (maybe extending the future framework) for asynchronous parallelization and parallel programming.

If you feel like one of the projects sparks your interest, feel free to get in contact with us (mlr-org@stat.uni-muenchen.de)!
Similarly, if you would like to **propose your own idea/project** also get in contact with us, and we will figure out if this is a fit for our organization!
