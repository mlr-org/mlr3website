mlr 2.10 is now on CRAN. Please update your package if you haven't done so in a while.

Here is an overview of the changes:

## functions - general
* fixed bug in resample when using predict = "train" (issue #1284)
* update to irace 2.0 -- there are algorithmic changes in irace that may affect
  performance
* generateFilterValuesData: fixed a bug wrt feature ordering
* imputeLearner: fixed a bug when data actually contained no NAs
* print.Learner: if a learner hyperpar was set to value "NA" this was not
  displayed in printer
* makeLearner, setHyperPars: if you mistype a learner or hyperpar name, mlr
  uses fuzzy matching to suggest the 3 closest names in the message
* tuneParams: tuning with irace is now also parallelized, i.e., different
  learner configs are evaluated in parallel.
* benchmark: mini fix, arg 'learners' now also accepts class strings
* object printers: some mlr printers show head previews of data.frames.
  these now also print info on the total nr of rows and cols and are less confusing
* aggregations: have better properties now, they know whether they require training or
  test set evals
* the filter methods have better R docs
* filter randomForestSRC.var.select: new arg "method"
* filter mrmr: fixed some smaller bugs and updated properties
* generateLearningCurveData: also accepts single learner, does not require a list
* plotThreshVsPerf: added "measures" arg
* plotPartialDependence: can create tile plots with joint partial dependence
  on two features for multiclass classification by facetting across the classes
* generatePartialDependenceData and generateFunctionalANOVAData: expanded
  "fun" argument to allow for calculation of weights
* new "?mlrFamilies" manual page which lists all families and the functions
  belonging to it
* we are converging on data.table as a standard internally, this should not
  change any API behavior on the outside, though
* generateHyperParsEffectData and plotHyperParsEffect now support more than 2
  hyperparameters
* linear.correlation, rank.correlation, anova.test: use Rfast instead of
  FSelector/custom implementation now, performance should be much better
* use of our own colAUC function instead of the ROCR package for AUC calculation
  to improve performance
* we output resample performance messages for every iteration now
* performance improvements for the auc measure
* createDummyFeatures supports vectors now
* removed the pretty.names argument from plotHyperParsEffect -- labels can be set
  though normal ggplot2 functions on the returned object
* Fixed a bad bug in resample, the slot "runtime" or a ResampleResult,
  when the runtime was measured not in seconds but e.g. mins. R measures then potentially in mins,
  but mlr claimed it would be seconds.
* New "dummy" learners (that disregard features completely) can be fitted now for baseline comparisons,
  see "featureless" learners below.

## functions - new
* filter: randomForest.importance
* generateFeatureImportanceData: permutation-based feature importance and local
  importance
* getFeatureImportanceLearner: new Learner API function
* getFeatureImportance: top level function to extract feature importance
  information
* calculateROCMeasures
* calculateConfusionMatrix: new confusion-matrix like function that calculates
  and tables many receiver operator measures
* makeLearners: create multiple learners at once
* getLearnerId, getLearnerType, getLearnerPredictType, getLearnerPackages
* getLearnerParamSet, getLearnerParVals
* getRRPredictionList
* addRRMeasure
* plotResiduals
* getLearnerShortName
* mergeBenchmarkResults

## functions - renamed
* Renamed rf.importance filter (now deprecated) to randomForestSRC.var.rfsrc
* Renamed rf.min.depth filter (now deprecated) to randomForestSRC.var.select
* Renamed getConfMatrix (now deprecated) to calculateConfusionMatrix
* Renamed setId (now deprecated) to setLearnerId

## functions - removed
* mergeBenchmarkResultLearner, mergeBenchmarkResultTask

## learners - general
* classif.ada: fixed some param problem with rpart.control params
* classif.cforest, regr.cforest, surv.cforest:
  removed parameters "minprob", "pvalue", "randomsplits"
  as these are set internally and cannot be changed by the user
* regr.GPfit: some more params for correlation kernel
* classif.xgboost, regr.xgboost: can now properly handle NAs (property was missing and other problems), added "colsample_bylevel" parameter
* adapted {classif,regr,surv}.ranger parameters for new ranger version

## learners - new
* multilabel.cforest
* surv.gbm
* regr.cvglmnet
* {classif,regr,surv}.gamboost
* classif.earth
* {classif,regr}.evtree
* {classif,regr}.evtree

## learners - removed
* classif.randomForestSRCSyn, regr.randomForestSRCSyn: due to continued stability issues

## measures - new
* ssr, qsr, lsr
* rrse, rae, mape
* kappa, wkappa
* msle, rmsle
