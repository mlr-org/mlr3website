You may have heard about the [drake](https://ropensci.github.io/drake/) package.
It got a lot attention recently in the R community because it simplifies reproducible workflow management.
This comes especially handy for large projects which have hundreds of intermediate steps.
Built-in High-Performance-Cluster (HPC) support and graph visualization are just two goodies that come on top of the basic functionality.

_drake_ is able to track changes in your intermediate targets.
This means once you change something in your early workflow pipeline, _drake_ will automatically update all follow-up objects that might be affected by this change.
The following tweet wraps the struggle of keeping track of dependencies in a research project in an simple picture:

The maintainer of _drake_, Will Landau ([\@wlandau](https://github.com/wlandau-lilly)) is extremely responsive and has also written one of the most extensive and detailed [manuals](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/) that exist in the R package jungle.

If you have installed _drake_, you can start right away with one of the built-in examples.

```r
drake::drake_example("mlr-slurm")
```

At the time of writing, there are 17(!) [examples](https://github.com/wlandau/drake-examples) that you can choose from.
One of the newest shows how to use _mlr_ with _drake_ on a HPC.

Machine-Learning projects/tasks interact especially well with the _drake_ idea since you can easily create [large comparison matrices](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/plans.html#large-plan) using different algorithms / hyperparameter settings.
At the same time _drake_ can sent these settings in parallel to a HPC for you, simplifying your modeling tasks a lot.
