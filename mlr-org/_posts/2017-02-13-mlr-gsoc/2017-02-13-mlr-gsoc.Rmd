We are happy to announce that we applied for a another [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) project in 2017.

[Operator Based Machine Learning Pipeline Construction](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2017/wiki/Operator-Based-Machine-Learning-Pipeline-Construction)

We aim to change the way we are currently doing data preprocessing in mlr. Have a look at the proposal linked above for more details.

If you are interested in doing this project, have a look at the tests and requirements.
