Due to the high amount of packages in the mlr3 ecosystem, it is hard to keep up with the latest changes across all packages. This posts gives an overview by listing the recent release notes of mlr3 packages from the last quarter. Note that only CRAN packages are listed here and the sort order is alphabetically.

# [bbotk](https://github.com/mlr-org/bbotk)

**Description: Black-Box Optimization Toolkit**

## 0.5.2

* refactor: The `$print()` method of `OptimInstance` omits unnecessary columns now.
* fix: The `$clear()` method of `OptimInstance` raised an error.
* fix: The `$clear()` method of `Archive` missed to reset the `$start_time` field.
* feat: `Optimizer` and `Terminator` objects have the optional field `$label` now.
* feat: `as.data.table()` functions for objects of class `Dictionary` have been extended with additional columns.
* feat: Add a `as.data.table.DictionaryTerminator()` function.

# 0.5.1

2* fix: The return of the `$.status()` method of `TerminatorRunTime` and `TerminatorClockTime` was not in a consistent unit.
  The return is in seconds from now on.
* fix: The number of evaluations was recorded as 0 in the log messages when the search space was empty.
* feat: Add a `as.data.table.DictionaryOptimizer()` function.
* feat: New `$help()` method which opens the manual page of an `Optimizer`.

## 0.5.0

* feat: Add `$nds_selection()` method to `Archive`.
* feat: New `Codomain` class that allows extra parameters.
* refactor: Objective values were automatically named.
  From now on, only unnamed returns of `ObjectiveRFun` are named.
* fix: `OptimInstance`, `Archive` and `Objective` objects  were not cloned properly.
* refactor: The fields `$param_classes`, `$properties` and `$packages` of `Optimizer` objects are read-only now.
* feat: The `branin()` function is exported now.

# [mlr3](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3)

**Description: Machine Learning in R - Next Generation**

## 0.13.3

* Most objects now have a new (optional) field `label`, i.e. `Task`,
  `TaskGenerator`, `Learner`, `Resampling`, and `Measure`.
* `as.data.table()` methods for objects of class `Dictonary` have been extended
  with additional columns.
* `as_task_classif.formula()` and `as_task_regr.formula()` now remove additional
  atrributes attached to the data which caused some some learners to break.
* Packages are now loaded prior to calling the `$train()` and `$predict()`
  methods of a `Learner`. This ensures that package loading errors are properly
  propagated and not affected by encapsulation (#771).

## 0.13.2

* Setting a fallback learner for a learner with encapsulation in its default
  settings now automatically sets encapsulation to `"evaluate"` (#763).
* `as_task_classif()` and `as_task_regr()` now support the construction of tasks
  using the formula interface, e.g. `as_task_regr(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars)`
  (#761).
* The row role `"validation"` has been renamed to `"holdout"`.
  In the next release, `mlr3` will start switching to the now more common terms
  `"train"`/`"validation"` instead of `"train"`/`"test"` for the sets created
  during resampling.


## 0.13.1

* Improved performance for many operations on `ResampleResult` and
  `BenchmarkResult`.
* `resample()` and `benchmark()` got a new argument `clone` to control which
  objects to clone before performing computations.
* Tasks are checked for infinite values during the conversion from `data.frame`
  to `Task` in `as_task_classif()` and `as_task_regr()`. A warning is signaled
  if any column contains infinite values.

# [mlr3filters](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3filters)

**Description: Filter-based feature selection for mlr3**

## 0.5.0

* Add references to benchmark paper and praznik paper (#104)
* New filter `FilterSelectedFeatures` which makes use of embedded feature selection methods of learners.
  See the help page for more details (#102)
* Allow `NA` as task type.
  This makes it possible to use other tasks than `"regr"` or `"classif"` for certain filters, e.g. `FilterVariance` (#106)

# [mlr3fselect](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3fselect)

**Description: Wrapper feature selection for mlr3**

## 0.7.0

* feat: Allow to pass `FSelector` objects as `method` in `fselect()` and `auto_fselector()`.
* feat: Added `$label` to `FSelector`s.
* docs: New examples with `fselect()` function.
* feat: `$help()` method which opens manual page of a `FSelector`.
* feat: Added a `as.data.table.DictionaryFSelector` function.
* feat: Added `min_features` parameter to `FSelectorSequential`.

## 0.6.1

* Add `store_models` flag to `fselect()`.
* Remove `store_x_domain` flag.

# [mlr3hyperband](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3hyperband)

**Description: Hyperband for 'mlr3'**

## 0.4.0

* feat: New `adjust_minimum_budget` flag in  `OptimizerSuccessiveHalving`. The
  minimum budget is adjusted in the base stage to use the maximum budget in last
  stage.
* feat: New `repetitions` parameter to specify the exact number of repetitions.
  Replaced the `repeats` parameter.

## 0.3.0

* feat: `TunerHyperband` evaluates configurations of same budget across
  brackets in parallel now.
* feat: New `repeats` parameter to repeat runs of successive halving and
  hyperband until termination.
* fix: Bug where maximization measures were minimized.

# [mlr3proba](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3proba)

**Description: Probabilistic Supervised Learning for 'mlr3'**

## 0.4.9

* Fixed bug in surv.logloss causing IPCW weighting to not be applied correctly

## 0.4.8

* Bug fixes in AUC measures

## 0.4.7

* Add right-censored log loss
* Fix bug in {rpart} where model was being discarded when set to be kept. Parameter `model` now called `keep_model`.

## 0.4.6

* Patch for upstream breakages
* Add `TaskSurv$kaplan` method
* {survivalmodels} now imported (previously suggested)

## 0.4.5

* Improved reduction from survival matrix predictions to ranking predictions
* Fixed cindex bug when all predictions equal
* Fix for valgrind

## 0.4.4

* Minor change to how distributions are created to better support improper distributions
* Fixed bug in `simsurv` task that made it impossible to predict the target

## 0.4.3

* Massive speed-up in distrcompositor PipeOp/pipeline
* More informative error given if `$distr` called for a learner that does not support this return type
* Fix massive bottleneck in scoring rule measures
* Add Density coercions `as_task_dens` and `as_prediction_dens`
* Measures now use parameter sets like learners. This streamlines the interface but unfortunately means ids can no longer be set dynamically.
* Add parameters `t_max` and `p_max` to Graf, Schmid and Integrated Log-loss as an alternative to `times`. `t_max` is equivalent to `times = seq(t_max)` and `p_max` is the proportion of censoring to integrate up to in the dataset.
* Fix bug in Rcpp code that was causing erroneous values for calculating the cindex in datasets greater than 20,000 observations.

# [mlr3spatial](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3spatial)

**Description: Support for Spatial Objects Within the 'mlr3' Ecosystem**

* Add `autoplot()` support for `"groups"` column role in `rsmp("cv")`
