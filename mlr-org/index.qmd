# mlr3: Machine Learning in R
</div>
An open-source collection of R packages providing a unified interface for machine learning in the R language.
Successor of [mlr](https://mlr.mlr-org.com/).

        div(class="feature-grid__icon",
          a(href = link, class = "feature-grid__link",
            tags$i(class = sprintf("bi-%s feature-grid__i", icon))
         )
       ),
      text
    )
  })
)
```

## Get Started

Install the full mlr3 universe at once.

```{r}
#| eval: false

install.packages("mlr3verse")
```

Read our [book](book.html) or start with a [gallery post](gallery.html).
