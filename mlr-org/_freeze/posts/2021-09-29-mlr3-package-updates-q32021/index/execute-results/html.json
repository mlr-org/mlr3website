Creates a custom resampling split\n  based on the levels of a user-provided factor variable.\n* New argument `encapsulate` for `resample()` and `benchmark()` to conveniently\n  enable encapsulation and also set the fallback learner to the\n  featureless learner. This is simply for convenience, configuring each learner\n  individually is still possible and allows a more fine-grained control (#634,\n  #642).\n* New field `parallel_predict` for `Learner` to enable parallel predictions via\n  the future backend. This currently is only enabled while calling the\n  `$predict()` or `$predict_newdata` methods and is disabled during `resample()`\n  and `benchmark()` where you have other means to parallelize.\n* Deprecated public (and already documented as internal) field `$data` in\n  `ResampleResult` and `BenchmarkResult` to simplify the API and avoid\n  confusion. The converter `as.data.table()` can be used instead to access the\n  internal data.\n* Measures now have formal hyperparameters. A popular example where this is\n  required is the F1 score, now implemented with customizable `beta`.\n* Changed default of argument `ordered` in `Task$data()` from `TRUE` to `FALSE`.\n\n# mlr3cluster 0.1.2 - https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3cluster\n\n**Description: Cluster Extension for 'mlr3'**\n\n* Add Hclust\n* test and doc hclust\n* Add within sum of squares measure\n* add doc wss\n* code factor adaptions\n\n# mlr3filters 0.4.2 - https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3filters\n\n**Description: Filter Based Feature Selection for 'mlr3'**\n\n- Fixes an issue where argument `nfeat` was not passed down to {praznik} filters (#97)\n\n\n# mlr3learners 0.5.1 - https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3learners\n\n**Description: Recommended Learners for 'mlr3'**\n\n- Improved how the added hyperparameter `mtry.ratio` is converted to `mtry` to\n  simplify tuning.\n\n\n# mlr3pipelines 0.3.4 - https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3pipelines\n\n**Description: Preprocessing Operators and Pipelines for 'mlr3'**\n\n* Stability: PipeOps don't crash when they have python/reticulate hyperparameter values.\n* Documentation: Titles of PipeOp documentation articles reworked.\n\n\n# mlr3spatiotempcv 1.0.0 - https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3spatiotempcv\n\n**Description: Spatiotemporal Resampling Methods for 'mlr3'**\n\n## Breaking\n\n- `autoplot()`: removed argument `crs`.\n  The CRS is now inferred from the supplied Task.\n  Setting a different CRS than the task might lead to spurious issues and the initial idea of changing the CRS for plotting to have proper axes labeling does not apply (anymore) (#144)\n\n## Features\n\n- Added `autoplot()` support for `ResamplingCustomCV` (#140)\n\n## Bug fixes\n\n- `\"spcv_block\"`: Assert error if folds > 2 when `selection = \"checkerboard\"` (#150)\n- Fixed row duplication when creating `TaskRegrST` tasks from `sf` objects (#152)\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\n- Upgrade tests to {vdiffr} 1.0.0\n- Add {rgdal} to suggests and required it in `\"spcv_block\"` since it is required in {blockCV} >= 2.1.4 and {sf} >= 1.0\n\n\n# mlr3tuning 0.9.0 - https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3tuning\n\n**Description: Tuning for 'mlr3'**\n\n- Adds `AutoTuner$base_learner()` method to extract the base learner from\n  nested learner objects.\n- `tune()` supports multi-criteria tuning.\n- Allows empty search space.\n- Adds `TunerIrace` from `irace` package.\n- `extract_inner_tuning_archives()` helper function to extract inner tuning\n  archives.\n- Removes `ArchiveTuning$extended_archive()` method. The `mlr3::ResampleResults` are\n  joined automatically by `as.data.table.TuningArchive()` and\n  `extract_inner_tuning_archives()`.\n\n\n# mlr3verse 0.2.3 - https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3verse\n\n**Description: Easily Install and Load the 'mlr3' Package Family**\n\n- Updated reexports.\n\n\n# mlr3viz 0.5.6 - https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3viz\n\n**Description: Visualizations for 'mlr3'**\n\n- Compatibility fix for mlr3tuning.\n- Fixed position of labels in barplot for `PredictionClassif`.\n\n# mlr3viz 0.5.5\n\n- Fixed another bug for ROC- and Precision-recall-curves (#79).\n",
