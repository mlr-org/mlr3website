in the meantime make sure to check out the package on GitHub.\n\n## [mlr3learners](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3learners)\n\nFor our curated set of learners we updated some ParamSet to the most recent versions and ensured that our custom \"Paramtest\", i.e. the heuristic how we validate the ParamSets of mlr3learners against their upstream packages, works again smoothly.\n\n## [mlr3fairness](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3fairness)\n\n{mlr3} now allows for bias auditing and debiasing through [mlr3fairness](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3fairness/) for arbitrary learners.\nThe package contains **Fairness Metrics**, **Debiasing Strategies** and **Visualizations** for\narbitrary models trained through {mlr3}.\nWe plan a to realease on CRAN soon, but the package is already usable.\nIf you wanna learn more, check out the tutorials for the individual components:\n\n- [Fairness Metrics](https://mlr3fairness.mlr-org.com/articles/measures-vignette.html)\n- [Debiasing Methods](https://mlr3fairness.mlr-org.com/articles/debiasing-vignette.html)\n- [Fairness Visualizations](https://mlr3fairness.mlr-org.com/articles/visualization-vignette.html)\n\n![mlr3fairness example plots](mlr3fairness-example.png)\n\n## [mlr3viz](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3viz)\n\nWe created a new ggplot2 theme `theme_mlr3()` which is being applied by default to all plots created with {mlr3viz}, i.e. all `autoplot()` methods in mlr3.\nThis theme is heavily inspired by `ggpubr::theme_pubr()`.\nIn addition to the theme, all mlr3viz plots now use the viridis color palette by default.\nLast, we have added some information how users can easily apply theming changes to the plots returned by `autoplot()`.\n\n![`theme_mlr3()` example plot](theme-mlr3-example.png)\n\n## [mlr3spatial](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3spatial)\n\nmlr3spatial is a new package for spatial backends able to handle {sf}, {stars} and {terra} objects.\nIt is capable of performing predictions on spatial raster objects in parallel using the internal mlr3 parallelization heuristic (which uses the {future} framework under the hood).\nTogether with the {mlr3spatiotempcv} package it extends the support for spatial machine learning in mlr3.\n\n## mlr-org meta\n\n## [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/mlr-org/projects/6)\n\nWe have createad a Roadmap of upcoming packages and planned features across the whole mlr3 ecosystem.\nThis roadmap aims both for internal organization and giving external people an idea of what is upcoming.\nThe roadmap is quite new and not yet fully operational at the time this blog post got released - however, we encourage to look at it from time to time as we try to keep it up-to-date.\n\n\n## [mlr3 wiki](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3/wiki)\n\nWe have updated and reorganized our [mlr3 wiki](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3/wiki).\nIt now has a better sidebar appearance for easier navigation and we have updated the sections with respect to their content.\n\n## [mlr3book](https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com)\n\n- Text and structure improvements (mainly for the basics chapter)\n- New introduction\n\n\n\n",
