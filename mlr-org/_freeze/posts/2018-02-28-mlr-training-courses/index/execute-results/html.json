It is a brand new extra-occupational 10-day training at the University of Munich (LMU).\nThe certificate program starts in May 2018 and the application deadline is March 15th, 2018.\n- You can request an inhouse R course in English or German via our [contact form.](http://www.muenchner-r-kurse.de/inhouse-schulungen/)\n- If you offer R or Data Science courses and want to include a course on [`mlr`: Machine Learning in R](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v17/15-066.html) into your course program, feel free to contact us at [rkurse@stat.uni-muenchen.de](rkurse@stat.uni-muenchen.de).",
