Note that this feature is still somewhat experimental.\n  See `HotstartStack` and #719.\n* New measures to score similarity of selected feature sets:\n  `sim.jaccard` (Jaccard Index) and `sim.phi` (Phi coefficient) (#690).\n* `predict_newdata()` now also supports `DataBackend` as input.\n* New function `install_pkgs()` to install required packages. This generic works\n  for all objects with a `packages` field as well as `ResampleResult` and\n  `BenchmarkResult` (#728).\n* New learner `regr.debug` for debugging.\n* New `Task` method `$set_levels()` to control how data with factor columns\n  is returned, independent of the used `DataBackend`.\n* Measures now return `NA` if prerequisite are not met (#699).\n  This allows to conveniently score your experiments with  multiple measures\n  having different requirements.\n* Feature names may no longer contain the special character `%`.\n\n\n## [mlr3benchmark 0.1.3](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3benchmark)\n\n**Description: Analysis and Visualisation of Benchmark Experiments**\n\n* Fix README.\n* Fix for PMCMRplus.\n\n\n## [mlr3db 0.4.2](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3db)\n\n**Description: Data Base Backend for 'mlr3'**\n\n* Compatibility fixes with new duckdb version.\n\n\n## [mlr3learners 0.5.1](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3learners)\n\n**Description: Recommended learners for mlr3**\n\n* `eval_metric()` is now explicitly set for xgboost learners to silence a\n  deprecation warning.\n* Improved how the added hyperparameter `mtry.ratio` is converted to `mtry` to\n  simplify tuning.\n* Multiple updates to hyperparameter sets.\n\n\n## [mlr3pipelines 0.4.0](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3pipelines)\n\n**Description: Preprocessing Operators and Pipelines for 'mlr3'**\n\n* New operator `%>>!%` that modifies Graphs in-place.\n* New methods `chain_graphs()`, `concat_graphs()`, `Graph$chain()` as alternatives for `%>>%` and `%>>!%`.\n* New methods `pos()` and `ppls()` which create lists of PipeOps/Graphs and can be seen as \"plural\" forms of `po()` and `ppl()`.\n* `po()` S3-method for PipeOp class that clones a PipeOp object and optionally modifies its attributes.\n* `Graph$add_pipeop()` now clones the PipeOp being added.\n* Documentation: Clarified documentation about cloning of input arguments in several places.\n* Performance enhancements for Graph concatenation.\n* More informative error outputs.\n* New attribute graph_model `GraphLearner` class, which gets the trained graph.\n* `as_learner()` S3-method for PipeOp class that turns wraps a PipeOp in a Graph and turns that into a Learner.\n* Changed PipeOps:\n  - `PipeOpHistBin`: renamed 'bins' Param to 'breaks'\n  - `PipeOpImputeHist`: fix handling of integer features spanning the entire represented integer range\n  - `PipeOpImputeOOR`: fix handling of integer features spanning the entire represented integer range\n  - `PipeOpProxy`: Avoid unnecessary clone\n  - `PipeOpScale`: Performance improvement\n\n\n## [mlr3proba 0.4.2](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3proba)\n\n**Description: Probabilistic Supervised Learning for 'mlr3'**\n\n* Patch for linux.\n\n\n## [mlr3spatial 0.1.0](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3spatial)\n\n**Description: Support for Spatial Objects Within the 'mlr3' Ecosystem**\n\n* Initial release.\n\n\n## [mlr3tuningspaces 0.0.1](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3tuningspaces)\n\n**Description: Search Spaces for Hyperparameter Tuning**\n\n* Initial release.\n\n\n## [mlr3viz 0.5.7](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3viz)\n\n**Description: Visualizations for 'mlr3'**\n\n* Compatibility fix for testthat.\n\n\n\n",
