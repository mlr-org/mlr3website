Februar 2018</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nThe maintainer of _drake_, Will Landau ([\\@wlandau](https://github.com/wlandau-lilly)) is extremely responsive and has also written one of the most extensive and detailed [manuals](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/) that exist in the R package jungle.\n\nIf you have installed _drake_, you can start right away with one of the built-in examples.\n\n```r\ndrake::drake_example(\"mlr-slurm\")\n```\n\nAt the time of writing, there are 17(!) [examples](https://github.com/wlandau/drake-examples) that you can choose from.\nOne of the newest shows how to use _mlr_ with _drake_ on a HPC.\n\nMachine-Learning projects/tasks interact especially well with the _drake_ idea since you can easily create [large comparison matrices](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/plans.html#large-plan) using different algorithms / hyperparameter settings.\nAt the same time _drake_ can sent these settings in parallel to a HPC for you, simplifying your modeling tasks a lot.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img width=\"100px\" src =\"drake.svg\" /></div>\n",
