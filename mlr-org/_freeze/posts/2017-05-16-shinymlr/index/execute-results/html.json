We enjoyed the work on this\nproject and will continue to maintain and extend our app in the future.\nHowever, after almost one year of work our application got a versatile tool\nand it is time to present it to a broader audience.\nTo introduce you to the workflow and main features of our app,\nwe uploaded a video series to our\n[youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxafH0u7ewWHEULXcEa_zkg).\nThe videos are little tutorials that illustrate the workflow\nin form of a use case:\nWe used the titanic data set from the\n[kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)\nas example data to show you step by step how it can be analyzed with our\napplication.\n\nThe first video gives a small introduction and shows you how data can be\nimported: [Tutorial 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZuRSQZdayY)\n\nIn the next tutorial you will learn how to visualise your data and\npreprocess it: [Tutorial 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKV4mg-wRts)\n\nThe third and fourth screencasts show you how to create your task and\nhow to construct and modify our built-in learning algorithms: [Tutorial 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPr-9dBbv6o), [Tutorial 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjeQzvEjoaQ)\n\nThe fifth part of our tutorials shows you how to tune your learners to find\nsuitable parameter settings for your given training set: [Tutorial 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMh4ZhRQhJI)\n\nThe sixth video gives you detailed information on how to actually train models\non your task, predict on new data and plot model diagnostic and prediction\nplots: [Tutorial 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxbc5YmI_i8)\n\nThe seventh video runs a benchmark experiment, to show you how to compare\ndifferent learners in our application: [Tutorial 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y1cfxtUCNY)\n\nThe last tutorial briefly demonstrates how to render an interactive report\nfrom your analysis done with our app: [Tutorial 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxHHYem4-s8)\n\nI hope you enjoyed watching the videos and learned how to make use of our\napplication.\nIf you like working with our app please leave us a star and follow us on\n[github](https://github.com/mlr-org/shinyMlr)\n",
