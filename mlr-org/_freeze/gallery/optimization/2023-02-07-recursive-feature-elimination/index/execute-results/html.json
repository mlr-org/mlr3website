learning algorithms.\nIn this article, we introduce the wrapper feature selection method *Recursive Feature Elimination*.\n[Wrapper methods](https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/feature-selection.html#fs-wrapper) iteratively select features that optimize a performance measure.\nAs an example, we will search for the optimal set of features for a [`gradient boosting machine`](https://mlr3extralearners.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_learners_classif.gbm.html) and [`support vector machine`](https://mlr3learners.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_learners_classif.svm.html) on the [`Sonar`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_tasks_pima.html) data set.\nWe assume that you are already familiar with the basic building blocks of the [mlr3 ecosystem](https://mlr-org.com/ecosystem.html).\nIf you are new to feature selection, we recommend reading the [feature selection chapter](https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/feature-selection.html) of the mlr3book first.\n\n# Recursive Feature Elimination\n\nRecursive Feature Elimination (RFE) is a widely used feature selection method for high-dimensional data sets.\nThe idea is to iteratively remove the weakest feature from a model until the desired number of features is reached.\nThe weakest feature is determined by the built-in feature importance method of the model.\nCurrently, RFE works with support vector machines (SVM), decision tree algorithms and gradient boosting machines (GBM).\nSupported learners are tagged with the `\"importance\"` property.\nFor a full list of supported learners, see the learner page on the [mlr-org website](https://mlr-org.com/learners.html) and search for `\"importance\"`.\n\n@guyon_gene_2002 developed the RFE algorithm for SVMs (SVM-RFE) to select informative genes in cancer classification.\nThe importance of the features is given by the weight vector of a linear support vector machine.\nThis method was later extended to other machine learning algorithms.\nThe only requirement is that the models can internally measure the feature importance.\nThe random forest algorithm offers multiple options for measuring feature importance.\nThe commonly used methods are the mean decrease in accuracy (MDA) and the mean decrease in impurity (MDI).\nThe MDA measures the decrease in accuracy for a feature if it was randomly permuted in the out-of-bag sample.\nThe MDI is the total reduction in node impurity when the feature is used for splitting.\nGradient boosting algorithms like [`XGBoost`](https://mlr3learners.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_learners_classif.xgboost.html), [`LightGBM`](https://mlr3extralearners.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_learners_classif.lightgbm.html) and [`GBM`](https://mlr3extralearners.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_learners_classif.gbm.html) use similar methods to measure the importance of the features.\n\nResampling strategies can be combined with the algorithm in different ways.\nThe frameworks scikit-learn [@pedregosa_scikit-learn_2011] and caret [@kuhn_building_2008] implement a variant called recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFE-CV) that estimates the optimal number of features with cross-validation first.\nThen one more RFE is carried out on the complete dataset with the optimal number of features as the final feature set size.\nThe RFE implementation in mlr3 can rank and aggregate importance scores across resampling iterations.\nWe will explore both variants in more detail below.\n\n[mlr3fselect](https://mlr3fselect.mlr-org.com) is the feature selection package of the [mlr3 ecosystem](https://mlr-org.com/ecosystem.html).\nIt implements the [`RFE`](https://mlr3fselect.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_fselectors_rfe.html) and [`RFE-CV`](https://mlr3fselect.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_fselectors_rfecv.html) algorithm.\nWe load all packages of the ecosystem with the [`mlr3verse`](https://mlr3verse.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr3verse-package.html) package.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(mlr3verse)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe retrieve the [`RFE`](https://mlr3fselect.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_fselectors_rfe.html) optimizer with the [`fs()`](https://mlr3fselect.mlr-org.com/reference/fs.html) function.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noptimizer = fs(\"rfe\",\n  n_features = 1,\n  feature_number = 1,\n  aggregation = \"rank\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe algorithm has multiple control parameters.\nThe optimizer stops when the number of features equals `n_features`.\nThe parameters `feature_number`, `feature_fraction` and `subset_size` determine the number of features that are removed in each iteration.\nThe `feature_number` option removes a fixed number of features in each iteration, whereas `feature_fraction` removes a fraction of the features.\nThe `subset_size` argument is a vector that specifies exactly how many features are removed in each iteration.\nThe parameters are mutually exclusive and the default is `feature_fraction = 0.5`.\nUsually, RFE fits a new model in each resampling iteration and calculates the feature importance again.\nWe can deactivate this behavior by setting `recursive = FALSE`.\nWhen running an RFE with a resampling strategy like cross-validation, multiple models and importance scores are generated.\nThe `aggregation` parameter determines how the importance scores are aggregated.\nThe option `\"rank\"` ranks the importance scores in each iteration and then averages the ranks of the features.\nThe feature with the lowest average rank is removed.\nThe option `\"mean\"` averages the importance scores of the features across the iterations.\nThe `\"mean\"` should only be used if the learner's importance scores can be reasonably averaged.\n\n# Task\n\nThe objective of the [`Sonar`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_tasks_sonar.html) data set is to predict whether a sonar signal bounced off a metal cylinder or a rock.\nThe data set includes 60 numerical features (see @fig-features).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntask = tsk(\"sonar\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell .column-page

[`FSelectInstanceSingleCrit`](https://mlr3fselect.mlr-org.com/reference/FSelectInstanceSingleCrit.html).\nIn addition to the task and learner, we have to select a [`resampling strategy`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Resampling.html) and [`performance measure`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Measure.html) to determine how the performance of a feature subset is evaluated.\nWe pass the `\"none\"` terminator because the `n_features` parameter of the optimizer determines when the feature selection stops.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r
