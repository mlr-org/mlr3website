Professor of Statistical Learning and Data Science at the LMU Munich.
I created mlr a long time ago at the beginning of my PhD.
Nowadays, I spend most of my time in project supervision, code reviews and helping to design new parts of the framework.
I was part of the design process of nearly all parts of the new mlr3, but nearly all code has been written by the other developers.
