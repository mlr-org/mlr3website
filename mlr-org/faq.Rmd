**Caching of `knitr`/`rmarkdown` chunks does not work with `mlr3`**

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
{knitr} per default uses R's lazy-load database to store the results of individual chunks.
The lazy-load database is an internal feature of R, and has issues handling active bindings (https://github.com/r-lib/R6/issues/152).
Fortunately, it is possible to disable lazy-loading by setting the chunk option `cache.lazy` to `FALSE`:

```r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE, cache.lazy = FALSE)
```
</details>


**How to keep all mlr3 packages up-to-date?**


<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Either run R's `update.packages()` to update all installed packages, or run

```r
devtools::update_packages("mlr3verse", dependencies = TRUE)
```

to update only packages from the mlr3verse. Note that this also updates recursive dependencies not listed as a direct import.
