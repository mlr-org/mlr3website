## When do I need nested resampling?

The goal of nested resampling is to obtain an unbiased estimator of the performance
of a tuned model. For further information see the corresponding
[book chapter](https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/optimization.html#nested-resampling).

## Something is missing, what now?

There is a designated chapter on how to extend mlr3 in our
[book](https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/special-tasks.html). Learner requests / additions can be
made through the [mlr3extralearners](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3extralearners) package.

## Can I simultaneously use implicit and explicit parallelizatio?
Using implicit parallelization (the learner's native parallelization) and explict parallelization
(via `future`) can lead to conflicts and there is little we can do do about it. For that reason
implicit parallelization id disabled by default.

## PipeOpLearner vs. PipeOpCV
